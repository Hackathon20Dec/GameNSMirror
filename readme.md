creating stardew valley
- [x] **Maps / Areas (FC):** show different areas (cafe/lobby, coworking floors, 13th floor partial, gym) and move between them.
- [ ] **Backend + DB:** auth + user data (NS username, join date, sign-in provider) + profile metadata (links/about).
- [ ] **Avatars:** use a real sprite sheet (or existing one); for early MVP, assign a random avatar from a fixed set (no custom creator yet).
- [x] **World interactions:** richer map with points/entries (Stardew / Pokémon vibe) using Phaser.
- [x] **GPT NPCs:** scheduled NPC behavior (early MVP: scripted schedules + "seemingly random" movement). NPCs: balaji, jackson, yash, otavio.

<!-- Down the line -->- [ ] **Social UI:** users clickable → profile view; small header UI for a timeline of NS people; "bookface" directory-style view.
